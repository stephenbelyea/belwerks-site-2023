I mean, you’ve got to be very welcoming of people with different disciplines and perspectives if you’re willing to bring in a curmudgeonly old front ender like myself, eh?</p>

<p>Together, we’re learning some of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/12/human-centered-design-matters/">pretty cool principles behind Human-Centred Design (HCD)</a>, from research, to prototyping, to getting our thoughts in front of the people who have problems that need solving as early as possible, to building better products based on what they share with us. I don’t mind saying that the more I learn about HCD and work within the team I’m on, the more it brings some light back to a career that’s been dimming for a while. That’s a big change for me, and I’m happy that I’ve found it.</p>

<p>One thing I love at the core of our design team is that we’re all here to learn and get better at what we do. Today, we’re exhibiting this by setting up a publication on Medium to share what we care about, what we’re learning, and what’s keeping us engaged! Keep an eye out for some posts from me on (what else?) accessibility.</p>
