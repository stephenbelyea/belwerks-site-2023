  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I quit Twitter a couple of years back. I’d been on it since 2011 and had built a decent-sized community of web developers, accessibility advocates, political progressives, and a healthy mix of friends and previous co-workers. Conferences and professional events were fun, as it made for a nice list of new follows and let me reach out to celebrate peoples’ work when I was much, much too nervous to speak with them in person.</p>

<p>Like many other things in life, the taint of Trump, wafting up from down South, made Twitter utterly unbearable. Mind you, the platform has been a hive of scum and villainy for years prior - but MAGA really opened the floodgates of people believing (correctly, as it would mostly seem) that they’d no longer be judged for their awful, bigoted views.</p>

<p>2016-2018 was a bad stretch for doom scrolling. It impacted my family life, my sleep, my level of irritation and radicalization – really, it was just generally awful all around. So, I left. I deleted my Twitter account and ditched all the community I had been building for years. I also deleted Instagram and locked down privacy and sharing on Facebook.</p>

<p>Flash forward to mid 2020, and I’m tuning in for <a href="https://inclusivedesign24.org/2020/">#ID24, the annual free online inclusive design conference</a>. Every single speaker would put up their Twitter handle at the end of a talk and nudge the conversation into that sphere. For the first major time since leaving, I really, really missed the positives of Twitter.</p>

<p>So, reluctantly, <a href="https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306425902788685825">I signed back up</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306426619712679938">regained my old @belwerks handle</a> pretty easily. I immediately started following and <a href="https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306739938868817920">engaging with everyone in attendance or speaking</a> at the conference. Many of them were people I’d previously followed and/or interacted with on the platform. It was nice.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/belwerks-site-2023/assets/first-tweet.png" alt="tweet from belwerks reads 'I'm back. The accessibility community is too Twitter-centric for me to keep off of Twitter. Does anyone know how to reclaim an old handle?'" />
  <figcaption>First Tweet… for the second time.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One key difference this time around has been the <a href="https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1306591911571066880">establishment of some ground rules</a>. I won’t follow companies, political figures, celebrities, or really any other avenues of blatant marketing and promotion. I will also never log into Twitter on my phone again. Or laptop. It stays on my iMac desktop, where I have to go to my study and fire it up on purpose. Same with Facebook.</p>

<p>I quickly built up a nice, positive feed of accessibility advocates and inclusive designers. Coincidentally, this also wound up with a progressive-minded feed, as far as political opinions go. Funny how that works, eh? It’s almost like compassion and empathy correlates with a particular side of the political spectrum…</p>

<p>It’s still impossible to avoid politics altogether - as I care deeply about human progress, equality, and justice, as well as investigative and ethical journalism. I still have doom scrolling moments - especially <a href="https://twitter.com/belwerks/status/1346927367651008516">during the recent insurrection attempt</a> - but it’s easier to step away when it isn’t on my phone or any other portable device. I recommend the same for everyone else.</p>

<p>In light of all this, you might notice a Twitter icon in my social links and a “keep the discussion going” shout-out at the bottom of every post now. I likely won’t respond right away (or at all, if you’re a dick about it), but I’m hoping it’s a good way to keep up the positive, communal aspects of this often-heinous platform.</p>
