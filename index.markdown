# Hello! You've reached Belwerks

## I'm Stephen Belyea

I am a front end developer with a heavy focus on accessibility, performance, and user interaction for any device or screen size. I like crafting experiences that anyone can use and I'll put in the effort to make sure they're able to do so easily.

A developer since 2012, I started in a LAMP stack, with a primary focus on WordPress. After some time in .NET, AngularJS, and early experience with TypeScript, I've settled into a modern JavaScript framework world. Most of my time has been in React, with projects in Angular and Vue to round out the framework trio. Jumping into new tech is a great way to learn and discover all the best and less-best parts of everything.

Feel free to reach out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebelyea/" target="_blank">LinkedIn <span class="visually-hidden">opens new tab</span></a> if youâ€™re in Kitchener and want to grab some coffee. Thanks for stopping by!
