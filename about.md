# A bit about me

I have been working as a web developer since 2012, starting out with Flash, jQuery, and PHP. I shifted over to vanilla JS around the time of HTML5 and CSS3 seeing wider adoption. During the great framework wars of the mid teens, I fought alongside React, Angular, and Vue. Since roughly 2018, React has been become my daily driver. I keep up with HTML and CSS advancements where I can (custom variables and grid are fun!) and like to tinker with native web components too.

Throughout my time in web, accessibility has been a primary focus. This lens has pushed my product and design thinking as much as code testing and quality. I make a habit of digging into the core problem and targeting a solution for the people encountering it. The web was designed and built with everyone in mind after all. It's only been narrow-minded product teams, designers, and developers who've closed it off.

I've worked more full-stack here and there, but am strongest and much more experienced in front end. I've also served in a couple of manager roles and learned plenty from the experience. People managing isn't for me, but I've grown to be a much better mentor and peer leader as a result.
