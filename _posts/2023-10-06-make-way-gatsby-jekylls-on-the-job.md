It has been quite some time since I've posted. So long, in fact, that when I tried to pull down my previous blog site on my new laptop, the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) setup was so out of date that it wouldn't build locally. I could have reviewed the plugins and searched out migration documentation, sure. But I took this as an opportunity to try out a different setup.

You're now reading this on a pretty basic [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/), built on [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I've been wanting to get to know **Rails** for many years, but the [Gems](https://rubygems.org/) and out-of-sight stuff was a bit too much to take-in all at once. A little too much server-side approach for my client-side JS brain!

Welp, here I am. Granted, a **Jekyll** app is hardly a deep dive into **Rails** - but it's a start.

If you notice some issues here and there, have patience. I have a running [list of issues logged in GitHub](https://github.com/stephenbelyea/belwerks-site-2023/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-asc) that I'll be chipping away at here and there.
